# Music_DB
Project Proposal
Import data from two different sources. Our first source will bring in a spotify featured artist database. Our second source has the artist name, facebook, and twitter id's so we can link the featured artist and their contact info.
We will use JupyterNotebook to clean our data and load into a MongoDB database.
